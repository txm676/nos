Title: Compute Node Overlap and Segregation in Ecological Networks
Version: 2.0.0
Author: Thomas J. Matthews and Giovanni Strona
Maintainer: Thomas J. Matthews <txm676@gmail.com>
Description: Calculate NOS (node overlap and segregation) and
    the associated metrics described in Strona and Veech (2015)
    <DOI:10.1111/2041-210X.12395> and Strona et al. (2017, In Press).
    The functions provided in the package enable assessment of
    structural patterns ranging from complete node segregation to perfect
    nestedness in a variety of network types. In addition, they provide a
    measure of network modularity.
