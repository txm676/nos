Title: Compute node overlap and segregation in ecological networks
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Thomas J. Matthews and Giovanni Strona
Maintainer: Thomas J. Matthews <txm676@gmail.com>
Description: A package to calculate the N_bar metric and associated NOS 
    framework in Strona et al. (2017). The functions provided in the package 
    enable assessment of structural patterns in a variety of network types 
    ranging from complete node segregation to perfect nestedness, in addition to
    providing a measure of network modularity.
